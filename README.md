#Fun with the IPC XML

Want to play with Python and the IPC XML from Wipo, to learn how to navigate this complex 12 level xml file containing the world largest categorization sheme with around 150.000 entries.

Had the idea and asked first a student intern with beautiful success to visualize the IPC, to make it navigationable for humans, to experience the beauty and complexity of the categorsation scheme. Then my friend Matze did last year a second approach with some other libs, you can find the result here: 

This is here just a place holder for me, as long as its for learning to program with python, I will keep, add and update some code snippets here.
